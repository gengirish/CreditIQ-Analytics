# Sample Data Generation Guidelines for CreditIQ Analytics

## Overview
This document provides guidelines for generating synthetic data to validate the CreditIQ Analytics platform for NBFC credit risk assessment.

## Data Sources and Types

### 1. Traditional Financial Data
- **Borrower Demographics**: Age, income, employment type, education, city tier
- **Credit History**: Existing loans, credit history length, traditional credit scores
- **Loan Details**: Amount, tenure, purpose, interest rates

### 2. Alternative Data Sources
- **UPI Transaction Data**: Monthly transaction frequency and patterns
- **Utility Payment Data**: Consistency in bill payments (electricity, mobile, internet)
- **GST Returns**: Filing frequency and compliance for business borrowers
- **Digital Wallet Usage**: Average balance and transaction frequency
- **E-commerce Behavior**: Online purchase patterns and frequency
- **Location Data**: Stability score based on location consistency
- **Mobile App Usage**: Time spent on financial apps

## ChatGPT Prompts for Data Generation

### Prompt 1: Borrower Profile Generation
"Generate 100 realistic borrower profiles for an Indian NBFC with the following fields:
- Age (18-65), Income (15K-20L INR), Employment type (Salaried/Self-employed/Business), 
- City tier (1/2/3), Education level, Existing loan count, Credit history months.
Make the data representative of India's demographic distribution."

### Prompt 2: Alternative Data Generation  
"Create alternative credit data for Indian borrowers including:
- Monthly UPI transactions (0-100), Utility bill payment consistency (0-1 score),
- GST returns filed (0-12 per year), Mobile recharge frequency, E-commerce transactions,
- Digital wallet average balance, Location stability score (0-1).
Ensure realistic correlations between variables."

### Prompt 3: Loan Default Scenarios
"Generate loan default scenarios considering:
- Higher default risk for: Lower income, irregular alt-data patterns, new credit users
- Lower default risk for: Consistent bill payments, stable location, regular UPI usage
- Include seasonal and economic factors affecting default rates"

## Validation Metrics
- Default rate should be between 3-15% (typical for Indian NBFCs)
- Strong correlation between alternative data consistency and lower default risk
- Income and employment stability should be primary risk factors

## Data Quality Checks
1. No missing values in critical fields
2. Realistic value ranges for all variables
3. Logical correlations between related variables
4. Balanced representation across demographic segments
